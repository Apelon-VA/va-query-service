    <title>Query Implementation</title>
    <para>This query implementation module implements queries against the Terminology Component
        Chronicle service, which can be forked <link
            xlink:href="https://github.com/IHTSDO/OTF-Versioning-Service">here</link>. The pure Java
        implementation of query capabilities is demonstrated in the integration tests and may be
        called independently of the REST service. The query implementation is called by the REST
        service to perform queries.</para>
